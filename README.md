# Dice-rolling-simulator
A dice rolling simulator is a digital computer model that works like normal dice and shows a random number between 1 and 6.
We can achieve this using the random library in python.
After importing the random module, you will have access to all of the module's functionalities. 
We'll utilize the random.choice() method for our needs. Based on the start and end values, this method outputs a random number.
The Python random.choice() function returns a random element from a sequence, and the sequence here is a range of values from 1 to 6.
I tried to make the result a visual representation of somethhing close to a dice.
At the end of the execution, the player is asked if they want to roll again.
I hope you enjoyed this simple Python project on a dice roll simulator.
